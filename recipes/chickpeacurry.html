        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a curry recipe I've done a couple times. It tastes good with rice.It's taken from Buzzfeed Tasty: <a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/easy-chickpea-curry-channa-masala">Tasty Link</a></p>

            <li>ginger, peeled and grated, 1 inch piece</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno (optional, I don't have very high spice tolerance so I usually put less or leave it out</li>
            <li>2 table spoons garam masala</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>

            <li>Add tomatoes, chickpeas and water. Stir, scrape off bits on the pot.</li>
