        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a stirfry recipe that I use a lot. It doesn't take a lot of time or preparation and it tastes pretty good.
            I learned most of it from my mom.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Eggs</li>
            <li>Some cooked rice (a little over 2 cups of cooked rice works, but honestly any amount works</li>
            <li>Broccoli</li>
            <li>Soy sauce, or oyster sauce</li>
            <li>Vinegar</li>
            <li>Chili oil (like laoganma)</li>
            <li>Cooked shrimp</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Garlic powder (optional, but I really like garlic)</li>
            <li>Cooking oil (like olive oil)</li>
            <li>Green onion</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put cooking oil in a pan and set it to medium heat.</li>
            <li>Cut the broccoli however you like it.</li>
            <li>Mince the garlic.</li>
            <li>Put the garlic in the pan. The pan should be hot enough that the garlic starts sizzling.</li>
            <li>After a few seconds, add the broccoli. The broccoli should also start sizzling.</li>
            <li>Stir the broccoli and garlic around a little bit.</li>
            <li>As the broccoli and garlic cook, add small amounts of water so they don't burn.</li>
            <li>After a few minutes (less than 5?), or when the consistency is how you like it, take the broccoli and garlic out of the pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add extra cooking oil to the pan if necessary.</li>
            <li>Crack in the two eggs and scramble them.</li>
            <li>When the eggs are still sort of gooey and not fully cooked, add the rice.</li>
            <li>Stir the rice and eggs around for several minutes, or until the eggs are almost cooked.</li>
            <li>Add back the broccoli and garlic, and the cooked shrimp.</li>
            <li>Add soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic powder in any amounts.</li>
            <li>Stir together for a few seconds, until the liquids are incorporated.</li>
            <li>Take everything out and put it in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Chop the green onion.</li>
            <li>Put green onion, chili oil, and salt in the food.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>Before you start cooking, you should have cooked rice and cooked shrimp on hand.</p>
